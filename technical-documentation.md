## Prompt Engineering: Iteration and Improvement Process

### Initial Approach (Week 1)
The initial prompt engineering focused on basic question generation with simple templates:
- **Basic Structure**: "Generate a physics question about [topic]"
- **Limited Context**: Minimal consideration for AP exam format and difficulty levels
- **Generic Outputs**: Questions lacked the specific rigor and format required for AP Physics C

### Iterative Improvements (Weeks 2-3)
**Enhanced Specificity**:
- Refined prompts to include AP Physics C curriculum standards
- Added specific difficulty levels (introductory, intermediate, advanced)
- Incorporated proper physics notation and mathematical formatting

**Context-Aware Generation**:
- Developed prompts that consider prerequisite knowledge
- Added topic-specific constraints (mechanics vs. electricity & magnetism)
- Implemented format-specific templates for MCQs vs. FRQs

### Advanced Optimization (Weeks 4-5)
**Multi-Step Prompt Chains**:
- Question generation → Solution verification → Explanation generation
- Quality assessment prompts to evaluate generated content
- Adaptive difficulty adjustment based on user performance

**Domain-Specific Enhancements**:
- Physics-specific vocabulary and concept integration

2. **Content Review**: Physics concept verification, difficulty appropriateness
3. **User Testing**: Real student feedback on question quality and learning value

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: AI Model Consistency
**Problem**: Different AI models produced varying quality and format consistency for physics questions.
**Solution**: Implemented a standardized prompt template system with specific physics notation requirements and format validation. Created fallback mechanisms to ensure consistent output regardless of the underlying AI model.

### Challenge 2: Real-Time Data Synchronization
**Problem**: Managing user progress, question history, and performance analytics across multiple sessions and devices.
**Solution**: Leveraged Convex's real-time database capabilities to automatically synchronize user data. Implemented optimistic updates for immediate UI feedback while ensuring data consistency through server-side validation.

### Challenge 3: Mathematical Notation Rendering
**Problem**: Displaying complex physics equations and mathematical expressions in a web browser environment.
**Solution**: Integrated KaTeX for LaTeX-style mathematical rendering, allowing proper display of equations, Greek letters, and scientific notation essential for physics problems.

### Challenge 4: Mobile Responsiveness
**Problem**: Physics problems often contain complex diagrams and lengthy equations that don't display well on mobile devices.
**Solution**: Implemented responsive design patterns using Tailwind CSS, created adaptive layouts that reflow content appropriately, and optimized touch interactions for mobile problem-solving.

### Challenge 5: User Authentication Security
**Problem**: Balancing ease of access with secure user data protection for educational content.
**Solution**: Implemented email-based OTP authentication through Convex Auth, providing secure access without requiring complex password management while maintaining user privacy.
